# DMA
The 8237A Multimode Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller is a peripheral interface circuit for microprocessor
systems. It is designed to improve system performance by allowing external devices to directly transfer
information from the system memory. Memory-to-memory transfer capability is also provided. The 8237A
offers a wide variety of programmable control features to enhance data throughput and system optimization
and to allow dynamic reconfiguration under program control.

##TRANSFER TYPES
*Memory-to-Memory transfers: that perform block moves of data from one memory address space to another
with a minimum of program effort and time, the 8237A includes a memory-to-memory transfer feature.
* Write transfers: that move data from an I/O device to the memory.
* Read transfers: that move data from memory to an I/O device.
